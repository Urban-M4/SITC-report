This document forms the technical documentation for the Summer in the City project (ESOCCS12.013). The project is a collaboration between Wageningen University and the Netherlands eScience center. The project ran from 2013 to 2016.

Code, scripts, and configuration files are [hosted on github](https://github.com/summerinthecity)

An online demo of the interactive heatwave map, developed as part of the project, can be found [on this website](http://summerinthecity.github.io/heatwavemap/); The visual-analytic UHI tool can be found [here](http://summerinthecity.github.io/uhitool).
