# App

As part of the project, a student developed a smartphone app to forecast the local temperature, it is available for Android here [Weerbeleving](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.swla.weerbeleving&hl=en)
It forecasts the thermal comfort index for windy and calm, and for sunny and shadowed conditions at your location.
The App uses the hi-resolution maps of the Netherlands to downscale the GFS forecast to street level, taking into account local conditions. A publication on the method is in preparation.
